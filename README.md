The Port Authority Complaint Reporter, sometimes called "Port Authority Complainter", is a small application to make it easier for riders to report issues with the Pittsburgh Port Authority bus system. It works by scraping & injecting javascript into [this page](http://www.portauthority.org/paac/apps/webcomments/pgcomment.asp?t=con), and was created to make it easier to report issues on mobile devices by auto-filling the date and time and remembering the name, email, and phone number fields.
